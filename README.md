# sequence_analysis

This is a general sequence analysis package, which is mainly designed such that it would be easy to use it as a submodule in different sequence classification tasks. One such example is the UCF101 action classification.

This is a multi-tower implementation which makes it easier to use in multi-GPU platforms.
